# PermalinkFu

A simple plugin for creating URL-friendly permalinks (slugs) from attributes.

    class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_permalink :title
    end

This will escape the title in a before_validation callback, turning e.g. "Föö!! Bàr" into "foo-bar".

The permalink is by default stored in the `permalink` attribute.

    has_permalink :title, :slug
  
will store it in `slug` instead.

    has_permalink [:category, :title]
  
will store a permalink form of `"#{category}-#{title}"`.

Permalinks are guaranteed unique: "foo-bar-2", "foo-bar-3" etc are used if there are conflicts. You can set the scope of the uniqueness like

    has_permalink :title, :scope => :blog_id

This means that two articles with the same `blog_id` can not have the same permalink, but two articles with different `blog_id`s can.

You can add conditions to `has_permalink` like so:

  	class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
  	  has_permalink :title, :if => Proc.new { |article| article.needs_permalink? }
  	end

Use the `:if` or `:unless` options to specify a Proc, method, or string to be called or evaluated. The permalink will only be generated if the option evaluates to true.

You can use `PermalinkFu.escape` to escape a string manually.

If you're having issues with Iconv, you can manually tweak `PermalinkFu.translation_to` `PermalinkFu.translation_from`.  These are set to `nil` if Iconv is not loaded.  You can also manually set them to `nil` if you don't want to use iconv.
